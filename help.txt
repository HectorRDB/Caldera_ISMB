Run the CALDERA script.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l LOC, --loc LOC     where to find the step 1 folder from DGWAS.
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Where to store the output. Default to loc/step2/
  -t THREADS, --threads THREADS
                        How many threads to use. Default to 1
  -C COMMUNITIES, --communities COMMUNITIES
                        Number of communities to find. Default to 3
  -P COMFILE, --comFile COMFILE
                        Location of the community assignement file. If none is
                        specified, default to k-means with k = communities
  --Lmax LMAX           Maximum size of each subgraph in bp. Default to 100
  -s SMAX, --Smax SMAX  Maximum value on number of stages to avoid exploring
                        the full graph. Default to 300
  -b BATCH_SIZE, --batch_size BATCH_SIZE
                        Maximum breath size. If it is reached, leads to hybrid
                        exploration. Default to 10 ** 10
  --alpha ALPHA         FWER Control value. Defaul to 10 ** (-8). A value of
                        zero will means that alpha is picked automatically.
  -v, --verbose         Wether to be verbose. If not specified (default), it
                        will not be verbose.
  --kmax KMAX           Maximum value on k to avoid exploring the full graph.
                        Default to 10 ** 8
  --dfs                 If this option is set, the code will be run in DFS
  --save_int            If this option is set, the current list of subgraphs
                        will be saved for future reruns.
  --restart             If this option is set, the code assumes that there is
                        a restart.

This program will save the list of significant connected subgraphs as well as
the associated p-values in the specified folder. Note that if runtime is too
slow, either increase the value of alpha, decrease sMax or increase the number
of cores. Caldera is quite memory intensive so make sure to keep track of
memory usage if running on a large file.
